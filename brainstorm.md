- Split a workbook by group 
- *Maybe* write a function 
- Sentiment analysis, maybe text pattern matching
- Fancy visualizations.... working with any objects _en masse_ is generally going to be easier in Python.
- Value counts and/or otherwise aggregating/summarizing data *on the fly* -- not tampering with the object itself
